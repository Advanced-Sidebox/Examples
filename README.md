Advanced Sidebox Example Addon Modules
========

These example modules are intended to help illustrate certain facets of Advanced Sidebox extensibility. Though none of them are very useful, the hope is that the specific concep covered in the example be highlighted more explicitly.

*These modules are compatible with ASB 2.1 and above.*
